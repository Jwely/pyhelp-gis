# This is a barebones git ignore. It is used to tell git NOT to track specific files, folders, or
# all files and folders that meet certain criteria, such as ending with '.pyc'. This allows programmers
# to keep their repositories as clean as possible by tracking only the critical files.

*.pyc
.idea
*get-pip.py
