# python-help
A documentation repository to help with frequently encountered issues getting started with python.

### Introduction

The python programming language can be exceptionally useful, is one of the most common languages used in the GIS community, and is a very suitable first programming language. Nearly everything I know is self taught, and I am NOT a python expert, but have gained a couple of years experience doing python programming for machine learning, data science, GIS, and for general interest. Every once in a while someone asks me a question with a solution that is best demonstrated by example code, and this repository serves as a loosely organized collection of examples and simple tools. Some of these little examples i've writen for myself to reference.

Disclamer: I approach these instructions with the assumption that the user will install PyCharm community edition,
and the github client.

### Getting started

I've decided the best way to approach this is to go force users to get established with github in the very beginning,
and a python interpreter that they can actually grow with. You might not understand why at first, but the instructions
are simple enough to follow.

* If you do not already have at least one version of python on your system, get one [here.](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
This tutorial should be cross compatible with both python 2.7.x and python 3.5.x.
* Create an account here on Github. It's easy and free, do it now.
* Fork this repository by clicking the button on the top right of your screen. This action will create a copy of this
code base just for you, you can even make changes, most of which will be saved.
* Download the github client from [here.](https://desktop.github.com/)
* Open up the client, log in with your github credentials, and clone the repository to your desktop computer.
You can do this from the `+` icon in the top left of the client window.
* Download PyCharm community edition from [here.](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows).
Do not download the free trial of the professional version.
